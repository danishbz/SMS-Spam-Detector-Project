    "    Spam SMSes is a serious problem. Spam SMSes contains links which when clicked on, will direct the users to a website or even a program which may leave them vulnerable to malicious scams, which may lead to their private credentials like passwords, social security number, and money stolen. When said credentials and money is stolen, it may be difficult to recover them or stop its distribution. At this point, prevention is better than a cure for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I have decided to work on a solution for the problem mention above. With natural language processing, we can filter out spam from legitimate messages sent over SMS. The solution for this problem using natural langauage processing is built upon prior work, namely Python modules like sklearn which utilises machine learning to train the model for SMS spam detection, and code of spam detector programs done by other individuals for guidance and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Having encountering spam messages myself, I was able to filter out spam messages easily since im well aware of the problem and what spam messages will look like. However, this may not apply to other individuals who in special cases, situations and circumstances, do not know about spam SMSes, how to detect them and how to counter it. We can help said individuals out with a solution that is simple for them to utilise so that they too can protect themselves from spam."

    "\tThe objective of the project is to identify and educate users on SMS spams. When the spam detector succesfully identify a spam, the user is able to learn what a SMS looks like and from there, able to figure out for themselves future spam SMSes that they may encounter in the future. This way, the elderly and the non-tech savvy are less likely to be affected by consequent problems than comes with spam. This will lead to decrease in spam cases from SMS and less resources for the government to spend to curb SMS spam cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe objective of the project is to detect and prevent spam SMS spams in the first place. As mentioned above, prevenetion is better than cure for this situation. Successful detection of SMS spams will result in conseqeuences of the spam not occuring. Without spam prevention, this is pose a problem further they encounter and SMS spam messages and do not take the necessary steps to counter them. SMS is also accessible to almost every individual in the world, which is why it is necessary for everyone of them to have access to spam detection and prevent themselves from getting scammed, no matter how non-tech savvy they are."

The dataset is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam. This dataset was colllect for free or free for research purposes on the Internet. \n",

    "\tA list of 425 SMS spam messages in the dataset was manually extracted from the Grumbletext website. This is a United Kingdom forum where SMS users make public claims about SMS spam messages. A collection of 3,375 SMSes randomly chosen ligitimate messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteeers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. A subset of 450 SMSes legitimate messages were collected from Caroline Tag’s PHD Thesis and finally 1002 legitimate and 322 spam SMSes where from the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big which is publicly available in the internet."

Initially the dataset from Kaggle is split into 80% training data and 20% testing data. This is so that we can test the model on the testing data after training it with the training data. The model will not see what the testing data looks like, so when it is make predictions on the testing data, it is valid and not exactly the same as the training data\n",

    "\tAn accuracy score than is more than 75% to 90% means that the model is doing an okay job with the spam prediciton. An accuracy score that is 90% and more is an excellent model.

    "\tThe training model is said to be solid when its accuracy of correct predictions on training data is almost the same as accuracy of correct predictions on testing data.

    "\tUsing the metric provided above, the accuracy of the model on training data has an accuracy of 96.7% and the accuracy of the model on testing data has an accuracy of 96.5%. This means that the model is excellent in detecting spam SMSes which are not known to them or never seen before. This means that it can be used outside of testing environment, were rea-world applications can be done on it.. Also, the model generally has a accuracy of more than 90% between both tests which means that the training carried out for the model is done excellently and it is sufficient enough without adding anymore data to it for extra training."

    "\n",
    "\tThis project poses to add on to counter-measures we have against SMS spams and the information we gained from it, like what SMS may likely to be spam, will be benefitial to us in how us as human beings can also learn from and figure out on our own where a message is spam or legit. Although there are others who have done spam detection programs, this project can also be taken into accoutn that its users can also learn further from its spam detection results compared to just relying on it too much without having any part of ourselves figuring it out on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis solution can also be transferred to be used in email spam detection to a certain extent, although email spam detection usually contain more scammer and phishing techniques which may require more data to learn from. However, most email software like Gmail, ProtonMail and Outlook have their own spam detection techniques and spam blocking programs implemented. This takes off some of the workload that the casual user needs to educate themselves on spam email and how to counter them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis project can be replicated for mobile development as a start. An example would be using implementing the project in iOS using Swift programming language and in Android using Kotlin programming language. The solution I have made is on Jupyter Notebooks which runs on Python, which is mostly available on PCs. By replicating the model on mobile, it is possible that the smartphone can also adopt spam blocking programs and allows users to use SMS with a peace of mind from spam."
